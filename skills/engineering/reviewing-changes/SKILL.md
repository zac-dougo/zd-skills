description: Four-pass review of a diff: code, security, architecture, acceptance. Optional AI-native pass on explicit request.
---

## Process

Always run the four default passes in order. Findings flow into one combined verdict. Pass 5 (AI-native practices) is opt-in: run it only when the user explicitly asks for it. Some repos are deliberately not AI-native and should not be graded against that rubric.

### 1. Read the rules

Before any pass, internalise the language conventions that match the diff (a conventions skill if the repo has one, otherwise its lint configs and documented standards) and engineering-philosophy. Those are the source of truth. Don't invent additional standards.

### 2. See the change

```
git diff <base>...HEAD
git log <base>..HEAD --oneline
```

For a GitHub PR:

```
gh pr view <N>
gh pr diff <N>
```

### 3. Pass 1: Code quality

Check, in order:

- **Philosophy violations**: over-engineering (KISS, YAGNI), duplication (DRY), magic behaviour (No Magic), copy-paste-modified blocks.
- **Redundant entity & local-pattern reuse**: when the diff adds a function, accessor, or code path the repo already provides (an auto-generated getter, a wider getter that subsumes a narrower one, an idiom a sibling file implements), reuse the existing form instead of a second variant. DRY and YAGNI span the whole repo, not just this diff.
- **SOLID violations**: Single Responsibility first; flag classes/files that grew a second responsibility.
- **Naming, readability, complexity**: function lengths, parameter lists, deeply nested conditionals, clever one-liners that hide intent.
- **Test coverage**: was the change tested? If TDD discipline applied, was the failing test committed first?
- **Tooling compliance**: ruff/mypy strict for Python, golangci-lint for Go, solhint:all for Solidity, forge fmt --check for Solidity formatting.
- **Configuration safety**: production timeouts, connection pools, missing retries, missing rate limits.

### 4. Pass 2: Security audit

Check, in order, against OWASP Top 10:

- **Injection**: SQL, command, LDAP, template, header injection via unsanitised input.
- **Broken authentication**: weak token handling, missing MFA, fragile session management.
- **Broken access control**: missing authz checks, privilege escalation, IDOR (insecure direct object reference).
- **Sensitive data exposure**: secrets in logs, error messages, or response bodies; missing TLS; weak ciphers.
- **Misconfiguration**: overly permissive CORS, missing security headers, debug endpoints exposed.
- **Vulnerable components**: `pip-audit` / `npm audit` / `govulncheck` / dep CVEs.
- **XSS**: unencoded output rendered as HTML/JS; missing CSP.
- **Insecure deserialisation**: `pickle.loads` on untrusted input, similar in JS/Java.
- **Insufficient logging and monitoring**: security-relevant events not logged, no alerting.
- **Cryptographic issues**: weak algorithms, hardcoded keys, missing key rotation, predictable IVs.
- **Smart-contract specific (if Solidity)**: reentrancy, integer over/underflow, unchecked external calls, access control on `onlyOwner`-style modifiers, front-running, MEV exposure, signature replay.

See `reference/owasp-checklist.md` for the canonical mapping with attack-vector notes.

### 5. Pass 3: Architecture consistency

- **Architecture map**: does the diff respect the `docs/architecture.md` (or equivalent) responsibility split? See `reference/architecture-map-pattern.md`.
- **Layer violations**: dependencies pointing the wrong way (e.g., domain importing infrastructure).
- **Boundary erosion**: public methods sneaking into private packages; circular dependencies.
- **Missing abstractions**: same logic implemented twice with minor variations.
- **Custom code where a library exists**: presumptive Critical when the diff reinvents primitives the ecosystem already solves (cryptography, encoding, standard-format parsers, wire codecs, retry/rate-limiting, ORMs, validators). Major for general utility code with a battle-tested equivalent. Three sub-checks:
  - **Already in tree**: if the project's lockfile already pulls in a library that exports the function being hand-rolled, the hand-rolled version is Critical regardless of LoC. Don't import one symbol and reinvent the others.
  - **Justification still valid**: comments that justified hand-rolling earlier ("avoid coupling", "keep dep tree small", "minimise binary size") must still hold for *this* diff. Once the dep is in the tree, the original reason has expired.
  - **What to grep for**: custom encoders for standard formats, raw wire-protocol bytes as constants, hand-rolled crypto primitives, hand-written auth-token verification, custom retry-with-backoff loops.
- **Pattern compliance**: clean architecture / DDD bounded contexts, only when the project documents a pattern.

### 6. Pass 4: Acceptance / intent alignment

Does the diff actually solve the contract (linked GitHub issue, PR description, or active Spec Kit `specs/<NNN>-<feature>/tasks.md` Block)? Cover the three axes:

- **Drift**: diff implements something related but not the asked feature.
- **Partial**: diff covers some required behaviours but misses others.
- **Overreach**: diff includes changes the issue did not request.

### 7. Pass 5: AI-Native-Coding Practices (opt-in, not part of the default gate)

Run only on explicit request (e.g. invoking the `review` skill with `ai-native`, or the user asking for an AI-native check). Validates the diff and the surrounding project against the empirically-grounded rubric for working with AI coding agents. Eight rules, citation-grounded:

- **R1**: Comments WHY not WHAT (load-bearing for LLM coding; inaccurate comments harmful).
- **R2**: Durable agent context belongs in instruction files. At least one of AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / `.cursor/rules/` must exist at repo root; section structure is guidance, not a graded checklist.
- **R3**: Tests prefer real objects over mocks; mock only at I/O boundaries.
- **R4**: Architectural decisions need ADRs: **only for projects using Spec Kit** (detected via `specs/` + `plan.md`/`tasks.md` or `.specify/`). Non-Spec-Kit projects skip R4.
- **R5**: Code review and PR hygiene survive AI throughput (small commits, decomposed PRs).
- **R6**: Conversational interaction is iterative, not one-shot.
- **R7**: Minimize context: delete, don't tombstone. Every line in always-loaded files costs every turn: remove rather than mark removed.
- **R8**: Mechanical-rubric subset belongs in CI; bundled templates ship with the plugin.

The rubric, with citations, lives at `reference/ai-native-rubric.md`. The mechanical-check templates ship at `reference/ai-native-templates/`.

## Quality Gate Summary

| Review              | Verdict        | Critical | Major | Minor |

**Overall**: PASS / NEEDS WORK / FAIL

### Action items
1. <Critical/Major items, ordered>
```

Append an `AI-Native Practices` row only when the opt-in Pass 5 ran.

For each individual finding:

- **Rule**: which rule was violated (with the language-rule skill or engineering-philosophy reference) or "best practice" if no codified rule.
- **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor.
- **Location**: `file:line`.
- **Issue**: what's wrong and (for security) the attack vector.
- **Fix**: concrete suggestion, with a short code example when it clarifies the change.

## Behavioural traits

- Constructive, educational tone. Teach; don't just flag.
- Specific, actionable feedback. "This is too complex" without a fix is useless.
- Severity matches reality. Critical for "this could ship a bug or a CVE today"; Major for "this will hurt within six months"; Minor for style and polish.
- Practical over theoretical security risks. If an attack requires three impossible preconditions, mark Minor.
- Defence in depth. Multiple weak controls beat one perfect control.
- Read-only. This skill never edits the diff itself; it reports.

## Cross-references

- `running-tdd-cycles`: preceding workflow; review confirms TDD discipline.
- `committing-changes`: commit-message + branch hygiene checks fold into the code-quality pass.
- The repo's language conventions (lint configs, style guides, or a conventions skill): the language rule the diff is being checked against.
- `engineering-philosophy`: KISS, YAGNI, DRY, SOLID weights for code-quality and architecture passes.

## Reference

- [reference/owasp-checklist.md](reference/owasp-checklist.md): canonical OWASP Top 10 mapping with attack vectors and fix patterns.
- [reference/architecture-map-pattern.md](reference/architecture-map-pattern.md): the optional `docs/architecture.md` convention this skill expects.

Run the four default passes in parallel subagents when the harness supports them (adding Pass 5 only on explicit request); otherwise run the passes sequentially inline.
