# Matt Pocock Skills

A collection of agent skills (slash commands and behaviors) loaded by Claude Code. Skills are organized into buckets and read from and write to the repository's issue tracker.

## Language

**Issue tracker**:
The tool that hosts a repo's issues: GitHub Issues, Linear, a local `.scratch/` markdown convention, or similar. Skills like `to-tickets` and `to-spec` read from and write to it.
_Avoid_: backlog manager, backlog backend, issue host

**Issue**:
A single tracked unit of work inside an **Issue tracker**: a bug, task, spec, or slice produced by `to-tickets`.
_Avoid_: ticket (use only when quoting external systems that call them tickets)

## Relationships

- An **Issue tracker** holds many **Issues**

## Flagged ambiguities

- "backlog" was previously used to mean both the *tool* hosting issues and the *body of work* inside it. Resolved: the tool is the **Issue tracker**; "backlog" is no longer used as a domain term.
- "backlog backend" / "backlog manager". Resolved: collapsed into **Issue tracker**.
